A simple, interactive To-Do List web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:**  
  Enter a task in the input box and click the plus button or press Enter to add it to your list.

- **Check/Uncheck Tasks:**  
  Click the square icon to mark a task as completed. The icon changes and the task text is struck through.

- **Edit Tasks:**  
  Click on the task text to edit it. Press Enter or click outside to save changes.

- **Delete Tasks:**  
  Click the cross icon to remove a task from the list.

- **Responsive UI:**  
  The layout is clean and adapts to different screen sizes.

- **Persistent Storage:**  
  All tasks are saved in your browser’s localStorage. Your list will remain even after refreshing or closing the page.

## How It Works

- Tasks are displayed with a square (checkbox) icon on the left, the task text in the center, and a cross (delete) icon on the right.
- Long task texts are truncated with an ellipsis (`...`) when not editing, and can be edited in-place.
- All actions (add, check, edit, delete) update the persistent storage automatically.
